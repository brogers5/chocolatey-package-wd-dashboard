    <description><![CDATA[# ⛔️ DEPRECATED

As a result of Western Digital having spun off its flash storage line of business, [development and support for Western Digital Dashboard has been discontinued](https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/52335) as of January 23rd, 2025.

Its successor is [SanDisk Dashboard (`sandisk-dashboard`)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sandisk-dashboard), a rebranded version of Western Digital Dashboard that supports Western Digital's legacy flash-storage products (including those carrying either SanDisk or WD branding), but with HDD-related features removed.

As the upstream software has been superseded, this Chocolatey package has therefore been deprecated.

If you require an alternative solution for Western Digital Dashboard's HDD-related features, consider installing [Western Digital Kitfox (`wd-kitfox`)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wd-kitfox).
